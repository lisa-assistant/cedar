 * A failed baseline run normally forces the docs-only fast path to fall back

 * was itself docs-only: in that case none of the code-gated jobs would have
 * run on the baseline either (they'd show up as `skipped`), so whatever made
 * it fail can't be a masked code regression - it has to be one of the few
 * jobs/steps that run unconditionally (e.g. the formatting check, which also
 * covers docs files).
 *
 * Crucially, the same reasoning applies even if that baseline *succeeded*: a
 * `success` conclusion on a run whose own triggering diff was docs-only is
 * just as uninformative about code health, since the code-gated jobs were
 * skipped there too - the run only proves the unconditional jobs pass, not
 * that the (unchanged) code does. So a docs-only run's conclusion - success
 * or failure - can never by itself be trusted as a "code is validated"
 * anchor. Only a run whose *own* triggering diff contained code changes
 * actually exercised the code-gated jobs, so only that run's conclusion is
 * meaningful.
 *
 * This walks back through the chain of consecutive docs-only-diffed runs -
 * regardless of their individual conclusions - until it finds the run that
 * last had a code-bearing diff (the run that last actually exercised the
 * code-gated jobs for this code state), and uses *that* run's conclusion as
 * the answer. Any untrustworthy diff, or running out of baselines to compare
 * against, makes the whole chain untrustworthy.
 *
 * This walks back by diffing, rather than by inspecting specific job/step
 * names, so it doesn't need to be kept in sync with ci.yml's job structure.

 *   against, or if any comparison in the chain can't be trusted
